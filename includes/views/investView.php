                    <p>Something is happening....While still in the early stages of development, an online book marketplace is coming soon. We are currently building the site and our inventory. We will sell our own new and used inventory as well as offering anyone the chance to sell their books through our site, creating a complete book marketplace. We feel these types of bookstores are becoming more important each and every day as the advent of new technologies slowly push the printed word aside. If you would like to be on the list of our startup investors, click the button below. We will forever immortalize your generosity on our thank you page. Please join us on this journey and help us preserve the printed word!</p>
